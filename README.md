# Stock_Analysis_System

## Introduction
Welcome to my Stock Analysis System project. This repository presents a sophisticated and comprehensive approach to stock market analysis, combining data-driven techniques with modern machine learning algorithms. Designed for enthusiasts, researchers, and traders, this project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of market dynamics and empower users with predictive tools for trading.

## Project Description
The System is an end-to-end system for financial market analysis, designed to uncover insights and predict stock market trends. By integrating technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and advanced forecasting models, this project stands at the intersection of finance and technology.

## Key Components
- Data Collection: Automated retrieval of historical stock data using yfinance.
- Data Preprocessing: Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Technical Analysis: Calculation of key indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD using talib.
- Sentiment Analysis: Extraction and analysis of financial news sentiments using web scraping (BeautifulSoup) and NLP (TextBlob).
- LSTM RNN Model: Implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for accurate stock price forecasting.
- Confidence Score Algorithm: A unique system that synthesizes technical, sentiment, and predictive analyses into a quantifiable confidence score.

## Technologies
This project leverages several technologies and libraries, including:

- Python: For all backend computations and data processing.
- Pandas & NumPy: Essential Python libraries for data handling and numerical operations.
- TA-Lib & TextBlob: For computing technical indicators and performing sentiment analysis.
- Keras & TensorFlow: For building and training the LSTM neural network model.
- Scikit-Learn: Specifically, the MinMaxScaler for data normalization.
